      <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
      <p>A way to avoid creating bugs while programming. A partner helps the other if they get stuck.
         One person drives/writes the code while the other person navigates.

      <h2>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>Since there are two people working on it, a pair can divide responsibilities
      and take advantage of each other's strengths. Gives a chance to solidify knowledge through
      teaching and learn from your partner.

      <h2>Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
      <p>
        The drive writes the code and doesn't need to focus on the big picture. The navigator focuses
        on the big picture and makes sure that the driver is in track.
