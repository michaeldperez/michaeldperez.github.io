  <h1>All In</h1>
  <h2>Ready to Play Ball with Devbootcamp</h2>

      Once you get to know me, you'll quickly learn that I am an avid <a href="http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/">Oakland Athletics</a> baseball fan. A motto among fans during the 2014 season was "All In," after the team traded our power-hitter and a number of minor league prospects and spent an abnormal amount of money to bring in talent from other teams (people even had cool <a href="https://twitter.com/visualingo/status/495270742359945216/photo/1">t-shirts</a> made). The A's (as the team is known) are famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) for using analytics to trade for, and to assemble rosters comprised of, undervalued, yet competitive players for the least amount of money (see <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball">Moneyball</a>). So when the A's made moves to acquire expensive big name players it was understood by fans and to all of Major League Baseball that the Athletics were making a definitive run for the World Series (sadly, it didn't work out; they lost to the Kansas City Royals in the AL Wild Card Game after 12 innings, breaking my heart in the process).

      I bring this up, not to open old wounds, but to draw similarities between my mentality during the A's 2014 season and my mindset going into Devbootcamp. I'm ALL IN. I'm ready to take ownership of my experience in the program; ready to work in the coding kitchen (I apologize for mixing metaphors here) and take responsibility for making the most of the program. I respect the fact that Devbootcamp is honest about the program still being experimental and I am excited to get in on what is still the ground floor. I did a lot of research into web development bootcamps before selecting Devbootcamp, and it is things like the <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside chat</a> that continuously reinforce this decision. I'm excited the participate in this type of learning environment and ready to begin the journey toward becoming a world-class beginning software developer.

      In particular, I'm enthusiastic to be joining an organization that promotes a "creator" mindset. I left academia after getting a PhD because (among other reasons) I was disheartened by the prevalence of the "consumer" mindset --the idea that because one has paid for a product or service one is owed or entitled to a particular experience and/or result. Unfortunately, I saw this type of mentality everyday among many students. Rather than taking responsibility for their experience in the classroom they wanted to be handed a diploma for simply coming into class a few days a week, for nine months out of the year, over four+ years. There were certainly students eager to learn and assume control of their education but the environment could easily be brought down by those that did not. I wanted something different culturally, and I'm confident that I've found what I'm looking for with Devbootcamp.
