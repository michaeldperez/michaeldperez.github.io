    <h3>Do You Need a Version Control System (VCS)?</h3>
    <p>
      In mathematics, a very useful way to prove a statement is through the method of "proof by contradiction." The idea is to demonstrate that assuming that the statement you want to prove is false leads to a nonsensical conclusion. The implication, then, is that it was incorrect to assume that the conclusion was false, and therefore the original conclusion is in fact true.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to convince you that as a developer you need a version control system in a manner similar to proof by contradiction. I want to show you that, regardless of whether you are a single user or working as part of a team, assuming you <em>don't</em> need some sort of version control system leads to all types of ridiculous conclusions. I'm probably abusing the proof by contradiction device here, but you'll get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a single user you don't need a version control system because:
      <ul>
        <li>You never need to recover a document from accidental deletions.</li>
        <li>You never possess more than one version of a document at any given time.</li>
        <li>You never need to check for differences between documents (because you don't keep multiple versions!).</li>
        <li>You never need to track past changes you've made.</li>
      </ul>
      In addition to the reasons above, as a team member you don't need a version control system since:
      <ul>
        <li>You don't need to share files between multiple machines.</li>
        <li>You don't need to collaborate across projects</li>
        <li>You never have multiple collaborators working on the same file at the same time.</li>
        <li>You never get stuck so you don't ever need to share code.</li>
        <li>You don't need a single, uniform method and framework within which your entire team can operate.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound absurd? That's because it is. Even as a single user you need version control because at a minimum it provides security against accidental deletions since you can roll-back to previously saved content. Furthermore, at some point you are likely going to want/need different versions of the same document, and version control makes it simple to keep track of each version as well as make a detailed note of just how they differ from one another. Finally, version control also makes it easy to track all of the changes you've made to a project. In fact, it will tell you <em>what</em> was changed, in what files, by <em>whom</em>, and exactly <em>when</em> those changes were made. Version control simplifies working on projects by enabling you to seamlessly move between versions of documents until you've settled on a "best" version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control becomes even more imperative when working in teams. You <em>will</em> need to pass files back and forth between team members, and there <em>will</em> be times when more than one of you is working of the same file. Version control allows each member to work on the document, making changes and taking note of those changes, and then eventually compile the versions into a single, complete document. Just imagine project life in the absence of version control: emailing different versions of the same document to one another and then having a team member join the files into a single document, manually resolving any conflict in content. And this would have to be done on. every. single. project file. Who wants to be that team member? Certainly not you. Not anyone. VCS tools reconcile these differences for you and ensure that each of you is working within the same parameters.

    <h3>Keeping Track of Changes with Git and Using GitHub to Store Your Code</h3>
    <p>
      Git as a software is one of a handful of version control systems. To understand how Git assists with tracking changes, think of a project as a tree. At the base or "trunk" of the tree is a directory (called a repository) holding all of your project files. Git allows you to "branch" off from the project trunk and work on an aspect of the project (i.e. a particular file), without affecting the integrity of the trunk. Git then allows you to merge the file back into the trunk once you're ready and convinced that re-integrating the file will not poison the tree. When you make changes to a document, Git immediately makes note of the fact that the version being worked on differs from the last saved version of the document (the last "committed" file in Git terminology) and tracks the specific alterations that were made. Changes can be saved by first telling Git to add the changed version it's been tracking to a temporary staging area, and then telling Git to save the file and record the specifics of the current version (the what was changed, when and by whom). As previously mentioned, because Git keeps a history of all the recorded changes, its possible to go back to a previous version at any time if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub is a social coding website where developers share their code and keep track of their versions on the Internet. Using Git alone only allows for local version control on your particular machine. GitHub expands version control remotely by uploading changes to identical repositories on the web. Thus, projects and project files exist both locally on your machine and remotely in similarly named directories on GitHub. You can then make changes to files in your local repository and then send those changes (called "pushing") to your remote repository. The two directories would again be identical. When changes exist (say, because you forgot to send the changes) Git will inform you that your repositories differ (and provides the means to determine exactly how). You can also make changes from your remote repository. For example, if you are working on a machine that is not your own you can download the changes you've made to you local repository when ready (called "pulling"). This is one of the many benefits of using GitHub; you can virtually work on a project from anywhere provided the machine has access to the Internet and Git installed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The true power of GitHub, like Git, is manifest when collaborating on projects. With GitHub all team members can have access to the project on their local computers as well as a central location from which to push and pull changes (it's literally a "hub" for your collective Git repositories). Working from the same remote repository makes collaboration much easier because team members can branch off from the main directory, work on files (again, even the same file), and then upload and merge their changes back to the central repository, thus sharing those changes at once with the rest of the team.
    </p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      So if you regularly find yourself in need of a method to handle multiple versions of documents and capable of keeping a detailed record of the changes, seriously consider using Git. And if you want remote access to your projects and/or plan to collaborate with others and would benefit from a common operating framework, look into GitHub. You'll thank yourself later.
