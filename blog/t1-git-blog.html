    <h3>Do you need a version control system (VCS)?</h3>
    <p>
      In mathematics, a very useful way to prove a statement is through the method of "proof by contradiction." The idea is to demonstrate that by assuming that the statment you want to prove is false leads to a nonsensical conclusion. The implication, then, is that it was incorrect to assume that the conclusion was false, and therefore the original conclusion is in fact true.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to convince you that as a developer you need a version control system in a manner similar to proof by contradiction. I want to show you that, regardless of whether you are a single user or working as part of a team, assuming you <em>dont't</em> need some sort of version control system leads to all types of rediculous conclusions. I'm probably abusing the proof by contradiction device here, but you'll get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a single user you don't need a version control system because:
      <ul>
        <li>You never need to recover a document from accidental deletions.</li>
        <li>You never possess more than one version of a document at any given time.</li>
        <li>You never need to check for differences between documents (because you don't keep multiple versions!).</li>
        <li>You never need to track past changes you've made.</li>
      </ul>
      In addition to the reasons above, as a team member you don't need a version control system since:
      <ul>
        <li>You don't need to share files between multiple machines.</li>
        <li>You don't need to collaborate accross projects</li>
        <li>You don't have multiple collaborators working on the same file at the same time.</li>
        <li>You never get stuck so you don't ever need to share code.<li>
        <li>You don't need a single, uniform method and set of rules for your entire team to use.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound absurd? That's because it is. Even as a single user you need version control because at a minimum it provides security against accidental deletions since you can roll-back to previously saved content. Furthermore, at some point you are likely going to want/need different versions of the same document, and version control makes it simple to keep track of each version as well as make a detailed note of just how they differ from one another. Finally, version control also makes it easy to track all of the changes you've made to a project. In fact, it will tell you <em>what</em> was changed, in what files, by <em>whom</em>, and exactly <em>when</em> those changes were made. Version control simplifies working on projects by enabling you to seamlessly move between versions of documents until you've settled on a "best" version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control becomes even more imperative when working in teams. You <em>will</em> need to pass files back and forth between team members, and there <em>will</em> be times when more than one of you is working of the same file. Version control allows each member to work on the document, making changes and taking note of those changes, and then eventually complile the versions into a single, complete document. Just imagine project life in the absence of version control: emailing different versions of the same document to one another and then having a team member join the files into a single document, manually resolving any conflict in content. And this would have to be done on. every. single. project file. Who wants to be that team member? Certainly not you. Not anyone. VCS tools reconcile these differences for you and ensure that each of you is working under the same parameters.
