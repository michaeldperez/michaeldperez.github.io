  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>30 January 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Stereotype threat is the menace of confirming a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs. This group membership may be in terms of age, gender, religion, culture, or ethnicity. It is being cognizant of the fact that one's own behavior might be viewed by others through the lens of a stereotype. Examples of stereotype threat include the stereotyped "expectation" for women to do more poorly than men in a mathematics course, or for African Americans to achieve lower scores compared to whites on standardized tests. Stereotype threat produces the negative consequences of academic under-achievement, a reduced sense of belonging to the stereotyped domain, and can cause individuals to value the domain in question less to a point that they choose not to participate, or pursue goals in the particular domain. For example, stereotype threat is often cited as a cause for women and minorities to refrain from obtaining STEM degrees and/or pursuing employment in certain sectors, such as the tech industry. There are even physical symptoms of stereotype threat, with subjects in studies admitting to being overly distracted, increasingly depressed, as well as exhibiting such ailments as an increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and a higher body temperature.  Overall, such threats have been a factor contributing to educational-, employment-, and social-inequality.

    I personally cannot recall a time in which I felt the pressure of stereotype threat. Anytime I felt pressure to perform, I honestly cannot identify the primary cause as being related to some sort of group membership. I went to a relatively diversified high school, and in college/grad school I studied the humanities and social sciences. While I think that although such stereotypes may exist among students in those disciplines, they are somewhat more muted because there is not the same expectations for particular groups to perform in a certain way as maybe there is in other areas, such as the sciences. I do remember being asked each time I enrolled in a Spanish class if I already spoke the language (given my Mexican heritage), but the expectation that I <em>should</em> already speak Spanish, or that I necessarily <em>should</em> perform better because of some cultural affinity, did not feel salient, and if it did exist, it certainly did not hinder my performance; I did fairly well.

    Nevertheless, just because I have yet to experience stereotype threat does not mean that I don't see it happen to others or that it will never happen to me. Simply because I have yet to face such threat does not mean that I am unaware of them or their potential to do harm. I'm writing this blog as part of the process toward becoming a software developer. And the tech industry is notorious for making it's non-white and non-male members feel stereotype threats. One often gets the sense that women and ethnic minorities are viewed as inferior when it comes to software development. That the industry is dominated by white males because of some (false) sense of innate ability that other groups simply don't possess. Women and minorities employees are seen as diversity hires, and cannot possibly do as good of a job as someone else. It's complete horseshit, but it is a view that appears to be well-entrenched and thus difficult to overcome.

      I think that DevBootcamp (DBC) is doing a great job at trying to combat stereotype threat. For one thing, they make a conscious effort to recruit women and other minorities into tech. While cost remains an prohibiting factor for many, they do at least ofter tuition assistance to certain underrepresented groups. That gets members of these groups into tech. Once at DBC, the instructors make a concerted effort to expose students to the fact that intelligence is malleable, and that <strong>anyone</strong> can learn software development, provided that they put in the time and effort. They also do things like have the students research social issues such as stereotype threat, to expose them to such concepts and raise awareness as to how they or others around them may be affected! Simply put, they make it clear from day one that students will be evaluated by no other criteria than how much effort they put into their own learning.

      All of these things are important. It teaches someone like me who may not feel as if stereotype threat has been a particular factor in their lives to not be blind to the situations of others in which it may have been or still be. It raises awareness of the issue and forces one to think critically about the effects of one's thoughts and reactions to other's behavior. It also opens up the potential for dialog between people from different backgrounds and group memberships. Prior to this assignment I had never come across the term "stereotype threat," even though on some level I was aware of the concept's existence. However, now that I have been exposed to it, and am aware of the harm it can cause, I am in a better position to confront it when faced with it&mdash;either when directed toward me, or someone else.
