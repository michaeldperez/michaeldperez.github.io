  <h1>CSS Positioning:</h1>
  <h2>When and How to the Position Property</h2>

    <h3>Improve Your Layouts with CSS's Position Property</h3>
    <p>
      Positioning elements on your site can either be the bane of your existence, or a feature that sets your page apart from others. Here I'll explain CSS's position property as well as how and when to use each of it's five values. Each value has it's specific purpose so it is important to understand how they differ in order to properly organize elements on your page. Usage of the position property is surprisingly simple and after reading this post you'll be well on your way toward creating beautifully laid out webpages.
    </p>
    <h4> The Static Position</h4>
    <p>
      Before we begin with the static position, it's important to keep in mind how elements are organized on your page. When you are writing your HTML, elements that appear above or before other elements in the markup are layered on top of those that follow. So, if you'd like, you can think of HTML elements as being stacked on top of one another like blocks. What the position property does is it allows you to alter how HTML elements relate to one another; If you don't want elements to be stacked directly on top of one another, you no longer have to. If you want, you can position an element anywhere on the screen or have it stay in a particular spot and never move (even when scrolling in your browser). The choice is yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "static" is the default value for all HTML elements, and they behave as their name implies. Static elements sit on top of one another and do not move from that position. Elements that come first in the HTML markup appear toward the top, and those that come toward the end of the document appear toward the bottom, like a tower. To illustrate, consider the following CSS code:
      <pre>
        <code>
          #square1s {
            background-color: #FF0000;
            height: 50px;
            position: static;
            width: 50px;
          }

          #square2s {
            background-color: #00FF00;
            height: 50px;
            position: static;
            width: 50px;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      The above code is for two elements: a red box and a green box. With each of these elements' position set to static they appear on the page with the red box stacked directly above the green box as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id="square1s"></div>
      <div id="square2s"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the properties that follow, an element with it's position property set to static cannot be altered using the standard offset properties of left:, right:, top:, bottom:.
    </p>
    <h4>The Relative Position</h4>
    <p>
      Similarly to elements with their position properties set to static, elements set to "absolute" layer on top of one another. Where they differ is in absolute-positioned element's ability to be offset with the left:, right:, top:, and bottom: properties. Take the following example. Here the red box is offset 20 pixels to the right by setting it's left: property to 20px:
      <pre>
        <code>
          #square1r {
            background-color: #FF0000;
            height: 50px;
            left: 20px;
            position: relative;
            width: 50px;
          }

          #square2r {
            background-color: #00FF00;
            height: 50px;
            position: relative;
            width: 50px;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      Here's how these squares would appear on your page:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id="square1r"></div>
      <div id="square2r"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that without the red square being offset by 20 pixels, the blocks would be stacked on top of one another no differently than if their position were set to static. Where relative-positioned elements get their name from is that they are offset <em>relative</em> to their parent element. In the examples used above (and throughout this post) the elements are positioned relative to the document itself. If an element is nested inside another element, it's position property and any offsetting properties are in relation to, or relative to, that parent element (instead of the document). Nevertheless, the practice of nesting elements within other elements and altering their position property is more common among elements set to "absolute" than set to relative.
    </p>
    <h4>The Absolute Position</h4>
    <p>
      The interesting thing about static and relative positioning is that offsetting an element using these properties does <em>not</em> affect in any way the elements that precede and/or follow. This can be observed above; Offsetting the red square had no affect on the positioning of the green square, which remains where it would have been if the red square had not been offset.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is <em>not</em> the case with elements whose position value is set to "absolute". Such elements are positioned in relation to the first parent element whose position is <em>not</em> set to static. These elements can effectively be positioned <em>anywhere</em> on the page, regardless of where other elements sit. In other words, the blocking or stacking effect of static- and/or relative-positioned elements no long holds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the best way to wrap one's head around this notion is through an example. The code below differs from the static squares' code only in having the position properties set to absolute.
      <pre>
      <code>
          #square1a {
            background-color: #FF0000;
            height: 50px;
            left: 20px;
            position: absolute;
            width: 50px;
          }

          #square2a {
            background-color: #00FF00;
            height: 50px;
            position: absolute;
            width: 50px;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="contain">
        <div id = "square1a"></div>
        <div id = "square2a"></div>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      It may appear as if the red square has disappeared. In actuality, the green square is sitting directly <em>on top of</em> the red square. Since absolute-positioned elements do not stack, the fact that the red square comes first in the hierarchy of code makes no difference. Both are positioned relative to the first parent not statically positioned. Since no such parent exists, in this case they are both positioned exactly the same way relative to the document itself. In order for us to see the red square, let's offset it a ways to the right:
    </p>
    <p>
    <div class = "contain2">
      <div id = "square1al"></div>
      <div id = "square2a"></div>
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the red square is visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should note that in writing this blog, it was easier to work with elements with their position properties set to absolute after nesting them within a parent element (e.g. a &lt;div&gt; tag) with an id or class whose height and width were sufficient to contain the elements.
    </p>
    <h4>The Fixed Position</h4>
    <p>
      Fixed-positioned elements share the same behavior as absolute-positioned objects. How they differ is that fixed-position elements are positioned in relation to the browser rather than the parent element. Also, as the name implies, the element is fixed in its position in the browser and does not move. This is true even when you scroll up and down. That little yellow block in the upper right-hand corner has it's position property set to fixed, and by now you have probably noticed that it has followed you as you have read down the page. The square was created with the following code:
    <pre>
      <code>
        #square1f {
          background-color: #FFFF00;
          height: 50px;
          top: 0;
          right: 0;
          position: fixed;
          width: 50px;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <div id = "square1f"></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      See? Nothin' to it!
    </p>
    <h4>The Inherit Property</h4>
    <p>
      The final position property is the "inherit" value. As you might have guessed, elements with their position property set in such a way inherit the value of their parent element. Recall that the default position property value is not inherit, but static. Thus, if you want elements to inherit their positioning from their parents their value will have to be set accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's pretty much all there is to an element's positioning. After you get a handle on the various types you'll be ready to design any layout you can imagine.
