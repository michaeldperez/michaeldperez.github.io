  <h1>Asking Good Coding Questions</h1>
  <h2>So How'd I do?</h2>

    <h3>Criteria of a Good Question</h3>
    <p>
      The kind folks over at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">StackOverflow</a> have shared their thoughts for asking questions that maximize the chance of receiving a helpful answer (see also Jon Skeet's <a href="http://goo.gl/C4EPoH">blog</a>). If you have time to read the original post, I suggest you do. However, here I briefly summarize their suggestions and use their criteria to evaluate my own questions asked on StackOverflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, a good question has been researched. Asking a question, the answer to which already exists and is readily available, will only infuriate others. So do yourself, and others, a favor, and research your question prior to asking. If the answers you found during your search are unsatisfactory, provide that information to help guide others who attempt to answer your question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, write a title that accurately describes your specific problem. Such a title is piques the interest of readers, and is constructed with correct spelling and grammar. A good question title narrows in on the problem instead of floating around a vague, broad, concept. Asking, for example, "why the JavaScript expression <span class="rbcode">4 == '4'</span> evaluates to <span class="rbcode">true</span>, whereas the expression <span class="rbcode">4 === '4'</span> is <span class="rbcode">false</span>," is much more expressive than asking "problem with '==' and '===' in JS."
    </p>
    <p>
      Third, take the time to introduce the problem before you include any code. Here, you'll want to go into some detail about what was only hinted at in your title. Take the time to explain the title, and be sure to discuss how you first encountered the issue, as well as any difficulties you've had solving the problem. Provide some context so that people trying to answer your question know from where you are coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, do what you can to help others reproduce the problem. Provide just enough code so that readers can reconstruct the issue you are having. This will help your readers gain perspective by experiencing for the issue themselves. If possible, it's best to provide a live coding example of the problem (e.g. on <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a>). However, if you do so, be sure to also include the code in the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure to proof-read before posting. This should go without saying, but anything you write, even coding questions, should be free of spelling and/or grammatical errors. If you want readers to answer your question you do not want to hamper, or at worst upset them, with poor spelling and grammar. It is a surefire way for your question to remain unanswered. In addition, make use of subject tags if the forum to which you are posting the question permits. Include tags for the specific language, library, and/or API you are using. This will help place your topic and draw the readers most qualified to address your issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, after you have posted be sure to respond to the feedback you receive. Thank the person or persons who have taken the time to help with your issue. If necessary, ask clarifying questions or any additional questions that arise as a result of your original question being answered. People have taken the time to look over, engage with, and hopeful answer your question. Be courteous and respond to their comments.
    </p>
    <h3>Evaluating A Question I've Asked on StackOverflow</h3>
    <p>
      I've asked two questions on StackOverFlow thus far. In this section I'll evaluate one of my questions according to the criteria outlined above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the two questions, can be found <a href="http://goo.gl/8eS4TB">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So how does my question stack up? First, you'll have to take my word for it that I did research the question before hand. Nevertheless, it turns out that a similar question <em>had</em> been asked before. This is noted by a link provided by one of the commenters. This shows that even researching a subject is no guarantee that you'll come across an answer even if it exists. The lesson, for me, is to try asking the question several ways when conducting research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does my title summarize the specific problem? I posted a statement and not a question. A better title would perhaps have been, "Is it possible to dynamically create and assign values to variables in Ruby?" This not only would have made clear the language I'm interested in, but also the specific concepts and techniques I want to know more about. Here, there is certainly room for improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did I introduce the problem before diving into the code? Somewhat. I do not really provide any additional information other than an example of what I'm interested in doing. I think the example is clear, but it could definitely use some more context. One commenter even asks, "What's the use case for this?" There is no discussion of how I encountered this issue or the difficulties I've had with it, other than, "this specific piece of code did not work." Next time I'll need to go into more depth so my readers know from where I am coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do think I helped others reproduce the problem. This was not difficult, considering there was only three lines of code, but none of the commenters expressed any difficulty working with the code snippet I provided. I think this is one of the criteria I fulfilled satisfactorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also proof-read and provided all relevant tags. As far as I can tell, there are no spelling or grammar errors in my post. I also tagged all the concepts upon which my question touched. I made explicit that I was working in <span class="rbcode">Ruby</span>, and that my post pertained to <span class="rbcode">array</span>s, <span class="rbcode">loop</span>s, <span class="rbcode">variables</span>, and <span class="rbcode">variable-assignment</span>. I received six comments, so I do not believe others had a difficult time locating the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I did a fairly good job <em>thanking</em> commenters for their responses. However, I probably could have engaged with their answers more thoroughly. For example, my original question implicitly asked about local variables, but the answer I received pertained to instance variables. One commenter made a note of this discrepancy, but I did not make any effort to clarify my needs or discuss the effect of this difference. For his part, the responder must assume that I was satisfied with his response. I was, but I should have been more polite and explained that it made no difference in my case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, considering that this was my first coding question asked on StackOverflow I think that I constructed the query fairly well. I researched to topic, made an effort to introduce the issue before moving onto the code, and I think readers were able to successfully reproduce the problem I was having. I used all relevant tags, proof-read before posting, and I made sure that I thanked all commenters for their responses. There are definitely areas for improvement, especially in terms of constructing a title and engaging with comments. Now that I know what constitutes a well-asked question, and am aware of past mistakes I have made in the past, I can learn from this experience and begin asking better questions.
