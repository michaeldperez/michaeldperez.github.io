  <h2>Net Neutrality in a Nutshell</h2>
  <h4>14 January 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <h3>What is Meant by "Net Neutrality?"</h3>
    <p>
      Net Neutrality is the notion that all Internet data should be treated equally. It's proponents argue that Internet service providers (ISPs) should not be permitted to charge different prices for data depending on it's size, nor should these companies be allowed to slow down or block access to particular sites and services for any reason. It is a response to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/15/fcc-approves-plan-to-allow-for-paid-priority-on-internet/">proposal</a> to allow ISPs to charge users different rates to transmit data across their networks.  Net Neutrality is an argument for keeping the Internet as it more or less currently exists; that is, where connectivity is unrelated to the sites you visit or online services your receive. Many proponents of Net Neutrality would prefer that the FCC create and protect a set of rules along the lines of those <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality">recommended</a> by President Barack Obama. In a nutshell, the ongoing debate over Net Neutrality is between advocates of the President's approach, and the telecom companies that would like for the Internet to remain unregulated altogether.

    <h3>What Do Proponents of Net Neutrality Say?</h3>
    <p>
    The primary concern for Net Neutrality proponents is the possibility that a handful of telecommunications companies (e.g. Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, etc.) will control what content is shared over the Internet. Advocates <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-net-neutrality-debate-in-2-minutes-or-less/">suggest</a> that without net neutrality codified into law, these ISPs will grant special treatment in the form of faster speeds and greater bandwidth to higher-paying customers at the expense of the general consumer and smaller companies. Furthermore, ISPs could give priority to media produced by companies under their control (such as TV networks they own, like Comcast and NBC), while slowing down the content of their rivals. In addition, the telecom giants could potentially prevent certain messages from being shared, simply because they disagree with the message's substance. Many also fear price inflation as Websites pass along the additional costs. In essence, net neutrality is&mdash;for it's <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/print/67512">proponents</a>&mdash;about keeping a free and open playing field so that any company, large or small, that relies on Internet traffic, can (continue to) grow and succeed.

    <h3>What Do Opponents of Net Neutrality Say?</h3>
    <p>
    The telecom companies would like to remain unregulated. Actually, what they would prefer is for broadband to remain classified as an "information service," as opposed to a "telecommunications service," subject to similar regulation as other public utilities. Critics of Net Neutrality <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-calls-on-fcc-to-issue-rules-protecting-net-neutrality-1415633678">point</a> to the fact that the Internet was been unregulated since it's inception, and as a result the tech industry has been witness to unprecedented levels of investment and innovation. If reclassified, innovation and techological advancement will be mired in bureaucratic red tape. As evidence, Comcast's Executive Vice President, David Cohen, drew <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/11/10/president-obama-net-neutrality-reaction/18797601/">attention</a> to Comcast's falling stock prices following Obama's announcement as an indication of apprehension on the part of investors. The firms also <a href="http://goo.gl/LlKk2V">argue</a> that without the ability to charge for higher speed connections, they will not have sufficient funds to invest toward faster networks for consumers. Responding to the the accusation that ISP will use the new rules to act as gatekeepers over the Internet's content, the ISP providers <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-net-neutrality-debate-in-2-minutes-or-less/">insist</a> that "unblocked access to lawful Web sites...will not change."

    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </p>
    <p>
    Just kidding! But not really. I have no idea how to resolve an issue I was required to spend 1.5 hours researching. But here goes:
