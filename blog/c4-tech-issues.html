  <h2>Net Neutrality in a Nutshell</h2>
  <h4>14 January 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <h3>What is Meant by "Net Neutrality?"</h3>
    <p>
      Net Neutrality is the notion that all Internet data should be treated equally. It's proponents argue that Internet service providers (ISPs) should not be permitted to charge different prices for data depending on it's size, nor should these companies be allowed to slow down or block access to particular sites and services for any reason. It is a response to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/15/fcc-approves-plan-to-allow-for-paid-priority-on-internet/">proposal</a> to allow ISPs to charge users different rates to transmit data across their network.  Net Neutrality is an argument for keeping the Internet as it more or less currently exists; that is, where connectivity is unrelated to the sites you visit or online services your receive.

    <h3>What Do Proponents of Net Neutrality Say?</h3>
    <p>
    The primary concern for net neutrality proponents is the possibility that a handful of telecommunications companies (e.g. Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, etc.) will control what content is shared over the Internet. Advocates <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-net-neutrality-debate-in-2-minutes-or-less/">suggest</a> that without net neutrality codified into law, these ISPs will grant special treatment in the form of faster speeds and greater bandwidth to higher-paying customers at the expense of the general consumer and smaller companies. Furthermore, ISPs could give priority to media produced by companies under their control (such as TV networks they own, like Comcast and NBC), while slowing down the content of their rivals. In addition, the telecom giants could potentially prevent certain messages from being shared, simply because they disagree with the message's substance. In essence, net neutrality is&mdash;for it's <a href="https://www.aclu.org/print/net-neutrality">proponents</a>&mdash;about keeping the Internet free and democratic.

    <h3>What do Opponents of Net Neutrality Say?</h3>
    <p>
    Net neutrality opponents <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2014/05/26/net-neutrality-dont-let-the-fcc-control">argue</a> that the world in which telecom companies play favorites is purely hypothetical, and that it is simply a ploy to allow the FCC to increase it's regulatory control over the Internet, and for current companies that crowd established networks with enormous amounts of data to continue to free-load. Under the currently proposed plan, the FCC will assume responsibility to review ISP offerings on a case-by-case basis, and reject plans deemed "commercially unreasonable" (whatever that means). Opponents fear that, if approved, the FCC's proposal will stymie innovation and prevent quick adjustment to the changing technological environment on account of the (assumed) increase in bureaucratic red-tape. Opponents also point to the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-net-neutrality-debate-in-2-minutes-or-less/">fact</a> that in 1998 the FCC classified ISPs as supplying an "information service," susceptible to very little government regulation, as opposed to a "telecommunication service," subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight as public utilities. Therefore, the FCC is overreaching with net neutrality. In any case, opponents are likely to point out that the Internet has operated fairly well without FCC regulation and there is no compelling reason, as of yet, for that to change.

    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </p>
    <p>
    Just kidding! But not really. I have no idea how to resolve an issue I was required to spend 1.5 hours researching. But here goes:
    </p>
    <p>
    In my opinion, the issue boils down to two essential points: the effect of net neutrality on innovation, and and it's effect on free speech. The dilemma is that both sides claim to be fighting on behalf of these principles. Without net neutrality, it is argued, ISP giants can squeeze out their rivals, and only big companies able to pay for quality service will be able survive. As a consequence, there will be far fewer innovative startups. On the other hand, there are those that argue against net neutrality, claiming that innovation thrives in deregulated markets. Furthermore, opponents argue that even if ISPs did begin to charge different rates, doing so would also facilitate innovation because, as in any market, scarce resources (which includes bandwidth) flow to their most profitable uses. And what is profitable? The the things people need and want. In other words, ultimately the consumer would benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
    It terms of net neutrality's effect of freedom of speech, proponents posit that ISPs, if left to their own devices, have the means as well as the incentive to control the content of the Internet. Therefore, the government needs to act in order to prevent the telecommunications industry from acting as gatekeeper. Opponents on the other hand, argue that government involvement is no guarantee to free speech. They claim that proponents hold a naive view of government as omniscient and benevolent, with the interests of "the people" at heart. In reality, opponents argue, regulatory law and regulatory agencies are often <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp">captured</a> by the very industries they are meant to oversee, thereby causing the very harm they were established to prevent. Thus, if there were to be net neutrality legislation, it would likely be written by lobbyists for the telecommunications industry.

    So where to I stand on this issue? In my brief amount of research, I have not come across a compelling argument for net neutrality. For the most part, calls for net neutrality appear alarmist and tend to solely focus on "what could be," rather than what actually is. To be sure, there have been <a href ="https://www.aclu.org/net-neutrality#abuses1">abuses</a>. For example, AT&T censored the lyrics of Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder as it streamed the band's concert from Chicago.  Nevertheless, I've been unable to find evidence of <em>widespread</em> abuse. Rather, I've only encountered a handful of cases, and that hardly necessitates wholesale government interference. In addition, I doubt that government interference in the form of net neutrality is the panacea it's proponents believe it to be. After all, in many instances the companies that are the object of net neutrality proponent's ire were granted their near-monopoly status <em>by</em> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5830956/why-the-government-wont-protect-you-from-getting-screwed-by-your-cable-company">government</a> in the first place. If and when I <em>am</em> presented with additional evidence, I'll certainly reconsider my view. But for the moment, "net neutrality" may simply be a solution in search of a problem.
