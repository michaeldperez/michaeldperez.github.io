  <h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>
  <h4>11 February 2015</h4>

    <h3>Handle Your Business Before It Handles You</h3>
    <p>
      I'm not a fan of conflict, and I generally prefer to avoid it rather than participate. If I ever do find myself in a conflict, it's because I've allowed myself to become angry to such an extent that I would much rather confront the person, than brood about the real or perceived affront in isolation. Nevertheless, there are a few things that immediately set me off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things in particular that I do not tolerate are violations of my privacy, and being taken advantage of. There was this one instance that I especially remember. My final year of undergrad I lived in a house with four other people. In such a situation, privacy and personal space are already difficult to come by. Among the five of us, I was the only one with a car. We lived in a more residential area of the city, somewhat away from campus, so it was often difficult for my roommates to get to and from class, as well as run basic errands, such as shopping for groceries. I did the best I could and offered to drive them around, and I even let it slide that I was rarely offered gas money in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I began to feel as if my roommates thought of my generosity as an entitlement, and I grew increasingly resentful with each additional request to be driven somewhere or to borrow my car. Things reached a boiling point when two of my roommates came into my room as I was asleep and took my car for some reason or another. When I found out what had occurred, I became infuriated at the lack of respect for my privacy, in addition to being taken advantage of. Here I had been, trying to help out my roommates, and to me it felt as if none of what I had done had earned me a modicum of respect. I felt that these two roommates in particular did not respect me enough to at least <em>wake</em> me and to <em>ask</em> to borrow my car. Instead, they assumed that they could just invade my personal space and take something of mine. I tried to imagine what I would have done in their situation, but I simply could not see myself behaving similarly. Because I know I would not have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confronted my roommates, and explained why what they did was unacceptable. I explained how their actions made me feel violated, and I made it clear (there may have been some yelling and off-color language) that I did not appreciate being taken advantage of. They were both contrite, and no other incident involving my personal space, or the abuse of my time and things occurred while we all lived together. This was partly because I had expressed how the incident made me feel, but partly due to the fact that I was far less accommodating with respect to driving around my roommates and/or allowing them to borrow my car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I still feel that I was increasingly being taken advantage of, and in this instance that my privacy had been violated. I also believe that confronting my roommates was the right thing to do, all else equal. However, I do believe that, for my part, much of my resentment and frustration could have been avoided had I laid out a set of ground rules ahead of time, or expressed my feelings earlier. I think I that my roommates and I were able to get past this incident without any permanent damage to our friendship. However, that could not have been the case. If I've learned anything from this incident, it's that if you do not deal with your feelings and emotions early, when you are still able to reason clearly and calmly, then your emotions end up getting out of hand and take control of you.
