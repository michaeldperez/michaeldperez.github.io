  <h1>Values and Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>6 February 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <h3>Affirmation as an Antidote</h3>
    <p>
     In a previous <a href="./c6-stereotype-threat.html">post</a> I discussed <strong>stereotype threat</strong>, the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs. In that discussion, it was pointed out that stereotype threat can cause substantial social, psychological, and physical harm, ranging from a reduced sense of belonging, depression, to even high blood pressure. I also pointed out that while I did not feel personally that I have ever succumbed to stereotype threat, I nonetheless recognized its significance and how it can be destructive and a create toxic environment if not directly confronted.

    Studies have identified <strong>affirmation</strong> as an antidote to the threat and consequence of stereotype threat. These inquiries have demonstrated that allowing someone to affirm their self-worth through the exercise of thinking about their characteristics, skills, values, and roles to which they personally attach value and view as important, can produce counter-acting effects to stereotype threat. For example, a study by <a href = "http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_martens_johns_greenberg_schimel.html">Martens, Johns, Greenberg, & Schimel (2006)</a> suggested that encouraging women to self-affirm eliminated the usual drop in academic performance invoked by stereotypes about gender differences in mathematical ability.

    While stereotype threat has not been a significant factor in my own life, when I do experience threats from similar feelings such as self-doubt or a lack of self-worth, what helps me persevere is thinking about how important is personal development. By personal development I mean growth, in terms of skills, knowledge, and understanding. This is an important value because it feeds into so many other values that are important to me, such as ambition, achievement, and self-reliance. I recognize that I alone am responsible for my growth and development. I may receive assistance from others along the way, but ultimately I must take ownership for myself. Thus, the goal is to make <em>little</em> improvements each day. I can, and should be ambitious, but achieving one's goals is more of a marathon than a sprint. I think that one of the worst things anyone can do is compare themselves to others and expect to develop, learn, etc. in the same way as somebody else.

    To illustrate, I'm currently in the process of learning JavaScript. As part of the DBC curriculum we were asked to create a game using JavaScript. Now, I didn't think my game was great to begin with, but once I saw what others had done, I almost allowed myself to feel depressed and fearful that I was falling behind. One of the features that impressed me most about the other students' work was how they integrated JavaScript into an HTML page. So, rather than wallow in self-doubt, I made it my goal to learn how to integrate JavaScript with HTML. This a very broad objective, so specifically I want to learn how to use JavaScript to alter a single HTML tag. That is a manageable goal and one I am likely to accomplish. Once I learn how to do this simple task, I'll know more about JavaScript than I did before. That is growth. From there, I'll assign a new small task for myself. Eventually, I'll be making games as sophisticated as some of my peers.

    While setting small goals and thinking about personal development certainly helps me in times of personal crisis, I do also think that it can help mediate stereotype threat, when either experienced by myself or someone else. Again, recognizing that you are responsible for taking command of your own learning experience, moving forward one step at a time, and not comparing yourself to others can help. If your objective is to make little improvements each day then it's easy to maintain a sense of accomplishment. And this creates a positive feedback loop between growth and achievement. We all did not necessarily begin from the same starting point, so it's expected that others may be ahead or behind in certain tasks or levels of understanding. Be aware of where <em>you</em> started, where you want to go, and take it one day at a time. Learn from those that may be ahead, and stop to assist those still catching up.
