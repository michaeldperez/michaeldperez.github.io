  <h1>Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
  <h2>An Abstract Sequential Thinker Tackles Dev Bootcamp</h2>
  <h4>8 January 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Signing up for Dev Bootcamp necessitates adapting to new learning environment and mindset. The program's educational model differs fundamentally from that offered by traditional trade schools, colleges, and universities. It's curriculum emphasizes learning new information through challenges and problem-solving rather than lectures. Students spend the majority of their time working and learning in pairs and/or groups instead of studying on their own. Furthermore, given the program's rigor, pace, and teaching style, the needs of every student cannot always be accommodated.

      As part of the process all students were asked to identify our learning and thinking styles, so as to be better able to tailor the Dev Bootcamp experience to our individual learning requirements. According to the Gregorc Mind Styles Model, my personal learning style is <em>Abstract Sequential</em>. I revel in theory and abstract thought; I'm able to conceive and visualize that which is unobservable, and I often rely on my intuition and imagination to look beyond the surface of things to discover the more subtle implications of the "unseen." I prefer to organize information in a linear, step-by-step fashion, and to follow a logical train of thought. I like to formulate a plan and stick to it rather than be impetuous. I'm basically a Vulcan who has attained <a href ="http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Kolinahr"><em>Kolinahr</em></a>.

      Knowing my thinking style will definitely help in adapting to the learning environment of Dev Bootcamp. In particular, my tendency to analyze situations prior to making decisions and acting, together with the penchant to apply logic to solve or find solutions to problems will definitely help with the various coding challenges and the final project.

      Looking back on my experience in the program thus far, the biggest struggle I've faced is getting enthusiastic about pair programming. As an abstract sequential thinker I learn best when working alone, able to progress at my own pace and research a topic thoroughly. And to be honest, I have not looked forward to peer programming, even though my experience with it thus far has been overwhelmingly positive. Despite working with very interesting and capable people, I still have the tendency to view each peer pairing session as a nuisance, forcing me to deviate from my own plan and schedule for working through the week's challenges. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that I dislike the <em>effect</em> peer programming has had on my planning, rather than the <em>process</em> of peer programming itself.

      Looking ahead to the coming weeks, I am worried that I may not do well when asked to participate in the program's emotional intelligence exercises. Expressing my emotions makes me uncomfortable and I have what often appears to be a physiological aversion to sentimentality. Due to the fact that I approach most things in a structured, logical, way, I find it difficult to understand alternative approaches. It is definitely something I am actively trying to address. For example, I'm aware of the issue and honest with myself about it. In addition, I make a concerted effort to be curious and ask and/or understand other's thinking styles and manners of working. Nevertheless, I recognize that there is nothing "wrong" with my thinking style nor those of others, and I do not feel any obligation to adapt to anyone's expectations of me. I am certain that I can embrace my thinking style and work on those aspects I <em>personally</em> feel need to be worked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that what may make this process proceed more smoothly is the fact that I consciously try to remain in a <a href = "http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth mindset</a>. Recognizing that I have some work to do, I believe that I can make the necessary changes, that I'm not fixed into a particular thinking style or behavior. I will try to embrace challenges and see them as learning opportunities, even if I happen to initially fail. I know that with continuous effort, anything is possible. I'm ready to put in the work.
