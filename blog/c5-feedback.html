    <h3>What is Pair Programming and Why is it Utilized?</h3>
    <p>
      Learning software development can be a difficult and frustrating experience. This is true regardless of whether one is learning on their own, in school, or in one of the many newly established coding bootcamps. To mitigate the hardship and the drudgery, many have turned to "pair programming." In pair programming, two developers work simultaneously on the same project (either side-by-side, or remotely at the same time), with only one programmer typing at any given time. The pair may a "driver-navigator" pairing, in which the driver codes according to the instructions and guidance of the navigator; the pair may "ping-pong," in which case one person writes tests for the code while the other person writes code to ensure that it passes the tests. This is a common form of pairing, especially in Test-Driven-Development (TDD) environments. In instances in which one person is more knowledgeable than the other, the two may choose "expert-novice" pairing. Depending on the nature of problem and/or goal of the session, the expert may drive or navigate. In other cases, the novice will simply observe, with the purpose of the session being to convey particular information. In most scenarios, however, it is expected for the pair to switch roles every so often.

      There are a number of benefits to pair programming. For example, pairing can reduce coding errors. Having two pairs of eyes on the code only increases the chances that if a mistake has been made, it will be caught, and caught early. Overall, this reduces the number of mistakes and cuts down on the time it takes to debug erroneous code. Pairing is also useful for sharing and transferring knowledge. Working with someone exposes you to new and sometimes more efficient ways of programming, which enables one to learn more quickly that often is possible when working alone. Pairs bring different modes of thinking and problem solving to each session, as well as different skill sets. It is much easier to learn something new when a particular problem or project can be approached from multiple angles and using a varied set of tools. Furthermore, pairing is useful in the workplace for bringing new team members up to speed on current projects. Having someone guide you through the project will acclimate you to the program much quicker than having to decipher the code yourself. The time wasted doing so can be better spent making quick and early contributions to the project.

    <h3>A.S.K.ing For and Submitting Feedback</h3>
      Nevertheless, becoming an effective and skillful pair programmer takes practice. As with anything, improvement is made only once we have solicited, received, and integrated feedback.
