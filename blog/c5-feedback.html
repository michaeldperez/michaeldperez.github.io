    <h3>What is Pair Programming and Why is it Utilized?</h3>
    <p>
      Learning software development can be a difficult and frustrating experience. This is true regardless of whether one is learning on their own, in school, or in one of the many newly established coding bootcamps. To mitigate the hardship and the drudgery, many have turned to "pair programming." In pair programming, two developers work simultaneously on the same project (either side-by-side, or remotely at the same time), with only one programmer typing at any given time. The pair may be a "driver-navigator" pairing, in which the driver codes according to the instructions and guidance of the navigator; the pair may "ping-pong," in which case one person writes tests for the code while the other person writes code to ensure that it passes the tests. This is a common form of pairing, especially in Test-Driven-Development (TDD) environments. In instances in which one person is more knowledgeable than the other, the two may choose "expert-novice" pairing. Depending on the nature of problem and/or goal of the session, the expert may drive or navigate. In other cases, the novice will simply observe, with the purpose of the session being to convey particular information. In most scenarios, however, it is expected for the pair to switch roles every so often.

      There are a number of benefits to pair programming. For example, pairing can reduce coding errors. Having two pairs of eyes on the code only increases the chances that if a mistake has been made, it will be caught, and caught early. Overall, this reduces the number of mistakes and cuts down on the time it takes to debug erroneous code. Pairing is also useful for sharing and transferring knowledge. Working with someone exposes you to new and sometimes more efficient ways of programming, which enables one to learn more quickly than often is possible when working alone. Pairs bring different modes of thinking and problem solving to each session, as well as different skill sets. It is much easier to learn something new when a particular problem or project can be approached from multiple angles and using a varied set of tools. Furthermore, pairing is useful in the workplace for bringing new team members up to speed on current projects. Having someone guide you through the project will acclimate you to the program much quicker than having to decipher the code for yourself. The time wasted doing so can be better spent making quick and early contributions to the project.

    <h3>A.S.K.ing For and Submitting Feedback</h3>
      Nevertheless, becoming an effective and skillful pair programmer takes practice. As with anything, improvement is made only after we have solicited, received, and integrated feedback. Effective and useful feedback has three characteristics. First, it is <strong>actionable</strong>. Effective feedback is feedback in which something can be done about it. Second, useful feedback is <strong>specific</strong>. For feedback to be helpful it must be to the point. Finally, good feedback is <strong>kind</strong>. By kind one does not mean "nice," but rather truthful and sincere. Receiving and giving feedback that is A.S.K worthy is the first step toward improvement. When one receives advice that is actionable, specific, and kind, he/she can integrate it into their learning by making the feedback to useful to them.

    <h3>My Personal Experience with Pairing and Receiving Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      I've pair programmed a total of eight times now. By and large it has been a beneficial experience. My first pair programming session was guided by a DBC mentor who taught my partner and I the ropes, and whose loose guidance for pairing I've been more or less following in my other sessions. What I've learned is that pairing can be useful regardless of whether there is a difference in knowledge and/or experience between pairs. Typically, this is because this difference is, at the moment, very small. Having a sympathetic student teach and assist you when you are struggling is less intimidating than being guided by someone much more advanced. It is also much easier when that person is in the process of learning the same material as are you. In cases when you happen to have a better grasp of the material, helping someone wrap their mind around it can really solidify your own knowledge and understanding. I have experience with both scenarios, and I can honestly say that while it may be better for one's ego to be the more knowledgeable pair in any given situation, both can be incredibly beneficial. It can be particularly rewarding to finally grasp a concept or discover an especially elusive solution to a problem thanks to the help of your pair, or to watch as your partner comes around thanks to your assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must be on the right track, because thus far the feedback from my peers has been overwhelmingly positive. Apparently I've been communicating effectively, have a solid grasp of the material, am considerate of the learning requirements of my partners, and patient with, as well as open to suggestions from, my pair. The few areas in which I may improve include deepening my knowledge of current versions of technology (e.g. HTML5), and perhaps work on my nerves (I am, after all, an introvert, and pairing is not something that comes naturally to me!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we are required to submit feedback after each pairing session I have been keeping up to date on the feedback I've received so as to incorporate it into subsequent sessions. I've integrated the feedback I've received by each time trying to maintain an open, clear, and judgment-free line of communication between my partner and me, as well as to remain patient when necessary. Receiving this feedback has been helpful because knowing what my peers think creates a comfortable working environment means that we can focus on programming rather than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even giving feedback has been helpful. In the process of giving feedback on your pair's performance during the session it becomes clear to you which actions/habits facilitate learning and successfully completing a challenge, and which make these objectives more difficult. Nevertheless, giving actionable, specific, and kind feedback can be difficult. You want to assist with your partner's learning process but you do not know how criticism, even entirely constructive criticism, will be received. The last thing you want to do is cause a peer to feel bad about themselves and/or become discouraged. I often find that I refrain from saying something because of the way in which it may be received. Deep down I know, however, that so long as my criticism is truthful and constructive, it can help someone improve. Conversely, by withholding that information they are missing out on an opportunity to learn. Doing so may even be patronizing, because I'm assuming that they will not be able to handle the feedback and as a consequence I am robbing them of the opportunity to decide for themselves how to integrate that feedback. In other words, I may just be projecting. And that's not fair to them. I think that the biggest area of improvement for myself is learning to give constructive feedback and allowing others to deal with it as they will. It is their responsibility, just as it is mine anytime I am the recipient of feedback, to integrate criticism in a way that is most helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I do believe that using pairing and feedback will help guide my learning. I will learn more quickly and effectively with the assistance of others, and especially when each of us is committed to creating a productive learning environment.
