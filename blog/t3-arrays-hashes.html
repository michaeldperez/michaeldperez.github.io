  <h1>Ruby Container Objects:</h1>
  <h2>Comparing Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4>7 January 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Much of programming is dealing with collections of objects. For example, you may search through a customer database to pull information on specific order types, or you may sort individual cutomers by location. In Ruby, these objects are typically stored inside two types of <em>container</em>objects: <em>arrays</em>, and <em>hashes</em>. Here, I'll breifly describe both the <span class="rbcode">Array</span> and the <span class="rbcode">Hash</span> classes. I'll begin by introducing each class individually before concluding with a brief discussion on how they compare with one another.
    </p>
    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>
      An <em>array</em> is an ordered collection of objects. Objects within an array are indexed by integers. If <span class ="rbcode">n</span> is the length, or the total number of objects in the array, then objects in the array are indexed beginning with 0, and continue incrementally until the final object in the collection, which is indexed by <span clas="rbcode">n - 1</span>.
