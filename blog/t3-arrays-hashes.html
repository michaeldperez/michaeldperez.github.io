  <h1>Ruby Container Objects:</h1>
  <h2>Comparing Arrays and Hashes</h2>
  <h4>7 January 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Much of programming is dealing with collections of objects. For example, you may search through a customer database to pull information on specific order types, or you may sort individual cutomers by location. In Ruby, these objects are typically stored inside two types of <em>container</em> objects: <em>arrays</em>, and <em>hashes</em>. Here, I'll breifly describe both the <span class="rbcode">Array</span> and the <span class="rbcode">Hash</span> classes. I'll begin by introducing each class individually before concluding with a brief discussion on how they compare with one another. Since this is only a brief introduction to Ruby's container objects, those interested in a more thorough treatment are referred to "Chapter 9: Collection and Container Objects" in David A. Black's <a href="http://www.manning.com/black3/">The Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>, and "Chapter 3: Ruby's Building Blocks: Data, Expressions, and Flow Control" in Peter Cooper's <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430223634/">Beginning Ruby</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>
      An <em>array</em> is an ordered collection of objects. Objects within an array are indexed by integers. If <span class ="rbcode">n</span> is the length, or the total number of objects in the array, then objects in the array are indexed beginning with 0, and continue incrementally until the final object in the collection, which is indexed by <span clas="rbcode">n - 1</span>. Any object can be stored in an array: strings, numbers, booleans, symbols, even other arrays and hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays can be created one of four ways:
      <ul>
        <li>By making a call to the <span class = "rbcode">new</span> method.</li>
        <li>Literally, using the square-bracket array constructor.</li>
        <li>With the <span class = "rbcode">Array</span> method.</li>
        <li>With the special <span class = "rbcode">%w{...}</span> notation.</li>
      </ul>
      Here I'll only be using the literal notation because it is the most common among the various array constructors. Readers interested in learning the other methods for creating arrays are referred to Ruby's online documentation <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html">site</a> and/or the references cited above. Using the literal constructor, an empty array can be created as follows:
      <pre class = "prettyprint lang-rb">
        <code>
        &gt;&gt; x = []
        </code>
      </pre>
      Literal constructors can also accommodate objects placed within the array at the time of creation. For example:
      <pre class = "prettyprint lang-rb">
        <code>
        &gt;&gt; x = [1,2,'hello','world']
        </code>
      </pre>
      creates an array, assigned to the variable <span class = "rbcode">x</span>, which contains four elements: the numbers 1 and 2; as well as two strings: "hello" and "world". Note that asigning the array to the variable <span class = "rbcode">x</span> is arbitrary. One could just as easily have assigned the array to the variable <span class = "rbcode">a</span>, or the variable <span class = "rbcode">spaghetti</span>; It doesn't matter, although in your own code it <em>is</em> a good idea to label your variables in a way that is expressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, array objects are index by integers. Therefore, to access an element in an array, all one needs to do is reference the object by it's index in the array. For example, if we wanted to access the element "hello" in array <span class = "rbcode">x</span> above, all we would need to do is call the array and reference the "hello" element's index, which in this case is 2 (remember that indexing begins at 0 and since "hello" is the third element in the array it's index is 2):
      <pre class = "prettyprint lang-rb">
        <code>
          &gt;&gt; x[2]
          &gt;&gt; #=> "Hello"
        </code>
      </pre>
      As we can see referencing the the second index in the array x results in "hello" being printed to the terminal (as signified by the "#=>" character).
    </p>
    <p>
      Notably, array elements can be assigned to specific indicies--or reassigned if an element already exists--in a similar fashion. If we want to add the element "foo" to the array <span class = "rbcode">x</span> as it's fourth element, we can do so by simply typing:
      <pre class = "prettyprint lang-rb">
        <code>
          &gt;&gt; x[4] = 'foo'
          &gt;&gt; x
          &gt;&gt; #=> [1, 2, 'hello', 'world', 'foo']
        </code>
      </pre>
      Likewise, if we wanted to change the fifth element from "foo" to "bar", we would apply the same code again, this time assigning the fourth index to "bar" instead of "foo":
      <pre class = "prettyprint lang-rb linenums">
        <code>
          &gt;&gt; x
          &gt;&gt; #=> [1, 2, 'hello', 'world', 'foo']
          &gt;&gt; x[4] = 'bar'
          &gt;&gt; x
          &gt;&gt; #=> [1, 2, ,'hello', 'world', 'bar']
        </code>
      </pre>
      There are other was to add elements to existing arrays, so readers should consult the Ruby documentation and ensure that they are familiar with these techniques.
